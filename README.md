# AirBnb
AirBnB is a web application that is used to arrange or offer lodging, homestays, or tourism experiences. The app itself is meant to offer
these services as a hospitality broker, meaning that it doesn't neccessarily own any of the listings that are presented on the app however
it just collects commission for each booking made via the platform.
# Technologies
We have achieved the project using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Nodejs) Stack and that means we've used MongoDB for our database, 
Express for our back-end framework, Angular.js for our front-end framework and Node.js for our back-end runtime environment.
# Guidelines
> Download the application code into your computer/laptop.
> Run the following commands to set the enviroment
- "npm install", which installs all of the dependances for the web application.
- "nodemon", starts the server and connects to the database. 
> Go to browser and type in "localhost:3000" after that the application itself should be running and you'll enjoy all the functioinality
that we've implemented.
# Challenges
> ğŸ˜”We have struggled to be able to fetch and display the property images that are uploaded into database, however we are still making our research and trying out possible alternatives to achieve this goal, this is because we fully understand that it very easy to "buy what you see".
